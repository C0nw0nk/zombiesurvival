## Removed :

To remove the draw written inside Resupply box that says "ur a faget" edit the following. https://github.com/C0nw0nk/zombiesurvival/blob/master/gamemodes/zombiesurvival/entities/entities/prop_resupplybox/cl_init.lua#L83

# How to install :

Install the addon to the `"/garrysmod/gamemodes/"` folder.

The path to should look like this : `"/garrysmod/gamemodes/zombiesurvival/"`

# How to use :

For those who intend on running public game servers you must also add to your servers command line the following.

`+gamemode zombiesurvival`

In full your command line should be similar to this.

`srcds.exe -console -game garrysmod +gamemode zombiesurvival +map zs_map_name`

#### Crashes and Logs :

##### Logs :

To enable logging to see what players get upto ingame and also what they say or talk about on the server and to help you administrate your server to confirm that players have been breaking rules abusive, trolling etc.

In the following directory :

`"/garrysmod/cfg/"`

You should add to your server config file `server.cfg`

```
logging on //Enable logging.
sv_logbans      1 //Log server bans in the server logs.
sv_logecho      1 //Echo log information to the console.
sv_logfile      1 //Log server information in the log file.
```

The logs will end up in the following directory `"/garrysmod/logs/"`

##### Crashes :

As we all know Garry's Mod can be unstabble and crash for no reason as well as suffer from memory leaks etc, The way we can ensure our server has the maximum amount of uptime is to add the following to our servers launch command line.

`-nocrashdialog` will help to prevent a dialog box asking you to close or send a error report that the server has crashed without this our server would hang and not automaticly start backup. (This depends if you have a script to automaticly restart your server when it crashes.)

`-nocrashdialog`

In full your command line should be similar to this.

`srcds.exe -nocrashdialog -console -game garrysmod +gamemode zombiesurvival +map zs_map_name`

###### Windows Crash issue :

On Windows servers when your server crashes you may recieve one of the following error messages / displays.

```
"srcds.exe has stopped working. Windows can check online for a solution to the problem"
"srcds.exe has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Please close the program"
```

In order to suppress these application hung/error messages completely you need to modify the system registry. The easyest way to do this is to Open a command prompt window (CMD) Make sure you Run As Administrator and execute the following to modify the registry to not display these error messages.

```
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Windows" /v ErrorMode /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting" /v DontShowUI /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

To auto restart your server on windows in the event of a crash you need to create a .bat/.cmd script here is a example.

Save it as : `server1.cmd`

```
@echo off
cls
echo Protecting srcds from crashes...
echo If you want to close srcds and this script, close the srcds window and type Y depending on your language followed by Enter.
title server1
:srcds
echo (%time%) srcds started.
start /wait /high C:\path-to-server\srcds.exe -nocrashdialog -console -game garrysmod +gamemode zombiesurvival +map zs_map_name
echo (%time%) WARNING: srcds closed or crashed, restarting.
goto srcds
```

# Secure your Server :

Nobody likes playing with cheaters so in order to prevent the cheating and hacking that revolves highly around the ZS game mode you should apply / consider running the following.

A Anti-Cheat : https://scriptfodder.com/scripts/view/460

To your servers command line add the following. (`sv_pure` has to be in the command line or else it will not work. Do not put it inside the `server.cfg`)

`+sv_pure 1` This will allow clients to only use models and files the server provides them with nothing modified or custom they have put into their folders. Because of the moronic confusion going on over the sv_pure command if you have custom models, sounds etc server side for the client to download and use then yes those will still work fine. Its a whitelist for server sided files if it does not exist on the server then the client is not allowed to use it simple.
In a nut shell sv_pure 1 enforces only what is in the models sounds etc server folders for the client to be able to use. If the client has extra files that do not match with the server they can't use them. (Prevents wallhacks etc.)

Should look like this : `srcds.exe -console -game garrysmod +gamemode zombiesurvival +sv_pure 1`

Disable clients from executing client side lua files : `+sv_allowcslua 0`

Should look like this : `srcds.exe -console -game garrysmod +gamemode zombiesurvival +sv_allowcslua 0`

Merge both the commands above your command line should be similar to this : `srcds.exe -console -game garrysmod +gamemode zombiesurvival +sv_pure 1 +sv_allowcslua 0`

Disable RCON weak RCON passwords or people guessing / bruteforcing or even dictionary attacking as well as other methods are a key flaw in servers you should disable RCON to not allow anyone to execute server sided commands via their client ingame console.

Setting the password to empty will disable RCON `rcon_password ""`

Prevent Clients uploading custom files to the server `sv_allowupload 0` there have been 0 day exploits in the past to do with players uploading files to the server with the following setting `sv_allowupload 0` will ensure that if these problems return we won't see them again. (The only downside effect this has is players can not upload or use/place their sprays ingame.)

An Admin addon to moderate and punish players my recommendation is ULX because it is the most popular and reliable as well as updated and maintained : http://ulyssesmod.net/downloads.php

Prevent players bypassing bans using Steam's family sharing features or throwing their money at Garry to buy the game over and over to troll your server : https://github.com/C0nw0nk/Garrys-Mod-Family-Sharing

# Secure Your Fast Downloads (FastDL sv_downloadurl) :

Nobody likes content scrapers, leechers nor people who hotlink of your servers fast download path consuming your money / bandwidth so here is the soloution.

##### Apache (.htaccess) :
```
# Check the user agent is Half Life 2.
SetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent "^Half-Life 2$" is_hl2
# Take into consideration blank / empty referers that are set to none.
SetEnvIf Referer "^$" valid_ref

# First server.
SetEnvIfNoCase Referer "^hl2:\/\/1\.2\.3\.4:27015$" valid_ref
# Second server.
SetEnvIfNoCase Referer "^hl2:\/\/1\.2\.3\.4:27016$" valid_ref

<RequireAll>
        Require env is_hl2
        Require env valid_ref
</RequireAll>

# Disable the directory indexing so we do not display to everyone the contents of the folder.
Options -Indexes
```

##### Nginx (location config) :
```
location /download-path/ {
  set $allowthis 0;
  # Check the user agent is Half Life 2.
  if ($http_user_agent !~ "^Half-Life 2$") {
    return 444;
  }
  # Take into consideration blank / empty referers that are set to none.
  if ($http_referer = "^$") {
    set $allowthis 1;
  }
  
  # First Server.
  if ($http_referer = "^hl2://1.2.3.4:27015$") {
    set $allowthis 1;
  }
  # Second Server.
  if ($http_referer = "^hl2://1.2.3.4:27016$") {
    set $allowthis 1;
  }

  if ($allowthis = 0) {
    return 444;
  }
  
  # Disable the directory indexing in nginx this is off by default but just to be sure we set it here.
  autoindex off;
}
```
